Project ideas
Title: MEMOZ

Description:
MEMOZ is a web app that will allow users to keep track of events and tasks. The website will be a split screen with one half being a bulletin board, and the other half being a calendar. Users will be able to add sticky notes to the whiteboard which will update the calendar side of the screen. Users will be able to add and remove sticky notes, which will add/remove the respective dates from the calendar. (Optional: The website will automatically remove sticky notes whose corresponding date has passed.)
 
The program will have 3 HTML windows: the login/welcome window, the register window, and the main program window. The main window will be split in half, with the left side being a bulletin board or whiteboard, and the right side being a calendar.
